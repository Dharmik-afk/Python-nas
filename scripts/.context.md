# Scripts Context: Automation & Operations

## 1. Scope
- **Management**: `scripts/manage.py` for user sync and DB operations.
- **Runtime**: `scripts/run.sh` for starting the supervisor.
- **Tooling**: Custom utilities like `context_loader.py`.

## 2. Guidelines
- **Python Scripts**: Should follow the project's Python style guide.
- **Shell Scripts**: Should be POSIX-compliant for maximum compatibility with Termux.
- **Safety**: Scripts that modify the system or filesystem MUST explain their actions and require confirmation in interactive environments.

## 3. Deployment & Maintenance
- **Venv**: Most scripts assume execution within the project's `venv/`.
- **Logs**: Centralized logging in `logs/server.log`.
