# Context: scripts/

## Purpose & Responsibility
Contains utility scripts for system management, user orchestration, and operational tooling. These scripts are designed to be run from the command line, often via `Makefile` targets.

## Key Symbols
- `scripts/manage.py`:
    - `add_user()`/`delete_user()`: Manages users in the SQLite database.
    - `sync_users_to_copyparty()`: Generates the `copyparty/copyparty.conf` file based on database users, ensuring credentials and permissions are synchronized.
- `scripts/run.sh`:
    - Robust launcher that handles `.env` loading, virtual environment selection (CPython vs PyPy), and starts the supervisor.
- `scripts/setup_system.sh`:
    - Provisioning script for Termux, ensuring all binary dependencies (FFmpeg, Python, PyPy, etc.) are installed.
- `scripts/context_loader.py`:
    - Implements the hierarchical context system. Merges `.context.md` files from a path up to the root and optionally applies role/task overlays.
- `scripts/verify_permissions.py`:
    - A diagnostic script to verify that the security jail and permission masks are correctly enforced by attempting restricted actions.

## Dependencies
- `app.core.config`: For directory paths and ports.
- `app.backend.database`: For user persistence.
- `supervisor`: Started by `run.sh`.
