# Context: app/frontend/templates/partials/

## Purpose & Responsibility
Reusable HTML fragments, primarily used by HTMX for dynamic content updates.

## Key Files
- `file_browser_content.html`: The core grid/list of files.
- `lightbox.html`: Alpine.js powered media viewer with zoom, swipe, and prefetching.
- `search_results.html`: Template for search hit display.
- `components/`: Smaller, atomic UI elements.
    - `file_card.html`: Individual file/folder item with action buttons.
    - `action_bar.html`: Top bar for upload/search/folder creation.

## Dependencies
- `HTMX`: Targets these partials for `hx-get` and `hx-post` responses.
- `Alpine.js`: Manages state within `lightbox.html`.
