# Frontend Context: HTMX, Alpine.js, & Jinja2

## 1. Interaction Strategy
- **HTMX**: Primary engine for partial UI swaps and server-side navigation.
  - Use `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-delete` for RESTful interactions.
  - Use `hx-target` and `hx-swap` to define UI updates.
  - Leverage `HX-Trigger` headers from the backend to signal client-side changes (e.g., toast notifications).
- **Alpine.js**: Handles local reactive state and complex browser interactions.
  - Used for the Lightbox, video player controls, and modals.
  - Communicates with HTMX via events (e.g., `@click="htmx.ajax(...)"`).

## 2. UI/UX Principles
- **Aesthetic**: Google Photos inspired (minimalist, floating popovers).
- **Mobile First**: All components must be touch-friendly and responsive.
- **Components**: Styled with Bootstrap CSS and Bootstrap Icons.

## 3. Templating
- **Jinja2**: Templates are located in `app/frontend/templates/`.
- **Layouts**: Base layouts in `templates/layouts/`.
- **Partials**: Reusable snippets in `templates/partials/`.
