# Context: app/frontend/

## Purpose & Responsibility
Contains the frontend logic and assets for the web application. It uses a server-side rendering (SSR) approach with Jinja2 templates, enhanced by HTMX for dynamic interactions and Alpine.js for lightweight client-side state.

## Sub-directories
- `routes/`: FastAPI routers for rendering HTML pages.
- `static/`: Client-side assets (CSS, JS, Icons).
- `templates/`: Jinja2 templates for pages and reusable partials.

## Dependencies
- `htmx.org`: For dynamic partial swaps.
- `alpinejs`: For UI interactions (e.g., lightbox, modals).
- `bootstrap`: For the base layout and components (CSS only).
- `bootstrap-icons`: For iconography.
- `artplayer.js`: Modern video player with gesture support.
