# Context: app/backend/services/

## Purpose & Responsibility
Contains service-level logic and integrations with the internal Copyparty file engine. This is where most of the proxying and internal protocol translation happens.

## Key Symbols
- `app/backend/services/copyparty_service.py`:
    - `proxy_stream_request()`: Handles complex streaming logic, including Range headers and thumbnail caching.
    - `get_pmask()`: Retrieves a user's permission mask from the backend.
    - `proxy_upload_request()`: Handles PUT-based file uploads to Copyparty.
    - `get_user_permissions_from_config()`: Parses `copyparty.conf` to extract user permissions (sync logic).
    - `search_files()`, `rename_item()`: Proxies search and management commands.

## Dependencies
- `requests`: Used for synchronous HTTP proxying to the internal Copyparty port.
- `app.core.config`: Configuration for the backend host/port.
