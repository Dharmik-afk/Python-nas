# Product Guidelines: Python FastAPI File Server

## Communication Style
*   **Documentation:** All technical documentation, administrative manuals, and developer guides must be **Professional & Concise**. They should prioritize clarity, directness, and accurate technical information while avoiding unnecessary jargon or conversational fluff.
*   **User-Facing Text:** Labels, tooltips, and instructional text within the web interface should be **Minimalist**. Provide only the essential information required for a user to perform an action, ensuring the UI remains uncluttered and efficient.

## Visual Identity & UI Design
*   **Clean & Modern:** The user interface should emphasize **whitespace, clear typography, and a consistent color palette**. This approach ensures that the application feels lightweight and is easy to navigate on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Visual Consistency:** Utilize a cohesive design system (based on Bootstrap) to maintain uniformity in components like buttons, cards, and navigation menus.

## Messaging & Terminology
*   **Functional & Literal:** Use clear, descriptive, and literal terms for all features and actions.
    *   *Examples:* Use "File Browser" instead of "Explore", "Downloads" instead of "My Stuff", and "User Settings" instead of "Profile Hub".
*   **Consistency:** Once a term is defined for a feature, it must be used consistently across the entire application and all levels of documentation.
*    **git:** when new track is being created make sure git pull is done before hand or check if it is latest one. if not notify the user immidently
